In Task 1, I created a function 'processArray' that squares even numbers and triples odd numbers 
by using the "map" method to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the input array.

In Task 2, I created a function 'formatArrrayStrings' that takes an array of strings and an array of numbers processed
by 'processedArray', and modifies each string based on its corresponding number. The 'formatArrayStrings' has two arguments 
that is strings and numbers.In the 'formatArrayStrings', it checks if both arrays have the same length.If not,it throws an error.
It then uses the 'map' method to create a new array by applying a function to each of the strings array and for each string it receives
the corresponding numers array by using the current index and it also checks if the number is even,then it converts string to uppercase or 
odd ,then it converts it string  to a lowercase.

In Task 3, I creaated a function 'createUserProfiles' that takes two arrays: one of the original names and the other modified names .
It then returns an array of objects where object contains 'originName', 'modifiedName', and auto-incremented 'ID'.
